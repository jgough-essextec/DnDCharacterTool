Write up a CLAUDE.md to do list for claude code to build and deploy this applicaton. The app will be built on django using postgres as the db. It will use zappa (https://github.com/zappa/Zappa) to deploy it to aws as a serverless app.

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive **CLAUDE.md** file that serves as a complete development roadmap for building and deploying your D&D Character Creator application. 

## ðŸ“‹ What's Included:

### **12 Major Phases** covering:

1. **Project Setup & Infrastructure** - Django, PostgreSQL, AWS configuration
2. **Core Django Apps & Models** - 24+ database models for all D&D content
3. **Django Admin & Data Population** - Import all D&D 2024 PHB content
4. **REST API Development** - 40+ endpoints with DRF
5. **Business Logic & Calculations** - Character stats, validation, exports
6. **Frontend Development** - Django Templates + HTMX + Alpine.js
7. **AWS & Zappa Deployment** - Complete serverless deployment guide
8. **Testing** - Unit, integration, E2E, performance, security
9. **Documentation** - Code, API, developer, and user docs
10. **CI/CD & DevOps** - GitHub Actions, monitoring, alerting
11. **Polish & Launch** - UX, accessibility, SEO, legal compliance
12. **Post-Launch & Maintenance** - Analytics, growth, scaling

### **Key Features:**

âœ… **500+ actionable checkboxes** - Track progress granularly
âœ… **Detailed technical specifications** - Exact commands, configurations, code structures
âœ… **AWS/Zappa deployment guide** - Complete serverless setup
âœ… **Database schema** - All 24 models needed
âœ… **API endpoints** - Every endpoint documented
âœ… **Timeline estimate** - 4-5.5 months for MVP
âœ… **Best practices** - Django, Zappa, AWS, security
âœ… **Useful commands** - Quick reference for common tasks
âœ… **Success metrics** - Clear launch criteria

### **Special Sections:**

- **Zappa configuration examples** with VPC, RDS, S3 setup
- **Complete AWS infrastructure** setup (RDS, S3, Lambda, API Gateway)
- **Django settings** split for local/production environments
- **CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring & alerting** with CloudWatch and Sentry
- **Performance optimization** strategies
- **Security hardening** checklist

This document is ready for use with **Claude Code** - each checkbox can be tackled sequentially, and the tasks are broken down into manageable pieces that Claude Code can implement step-by-step.

Would you like me to create any additional supporting documents, such as:
- Initial `zappa_settings.json` configuration file?
- Django `settings.py` template for production?
- GitHub Actions workflow files?
- Database schema diagram?
