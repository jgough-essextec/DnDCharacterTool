I'll help you create a comprehensive guide for building a D&D character creation app. Let me gather information from those websites.

Based on the information I gathered from D&D Beyond's official character creation guide, let me create a comprehensive markdown document that outlines the character creation steps and data requirements for your D&D character creation app.

I've created a comprehensive markdown guide for your D&D character creation app! The document includes:

## What's Covered:

1. **Step-by-Step Creation Process** - All 6 steps based on the 2024 Player's Handbook rules
2. **Complete Database Schema** - 24 tables covering all character data needs including:
   - Core game content (classes, species, backgrounds, feats, equipment, spells)
   - Character storage (abilities, skills, equipment, spells, features)
   - Relational data for proper linking

3. **Data Relationships** - How different choices flow and affect each other
4. **UI/UX Recommendations** - Progressive disclosure and validation rules
5. **API Endpoints** - Suggested REST endpoints for your backend
6. **2024 vs 2014 Changes** - Important differences to be aware of

## Key Insights:

The 2024 rules significantly changed the creation order - now you choose **Class → Background → Species** instead of the old Species-first approach. This is because:
- Backgrounds now provide ability score increases (not species)
- All backgrounds grant an Origin Feat
- Class choice influences optimal background selection

The database schema is designed to be flexible and support:
- Character progression through levels
- Equipment and spell management
- Proficiency tracking across all categories
- Future expansion (multiclassing, magic items, etc.)

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific area, such as the spell system, equipment management, or the actual implementation of the character creation flow?
