I want to create an app that will interactively guide a person to create a Dungeons & Dragons character. Before we create the app, we need the detailed step by step process to create a character and an understanding of the data that is needed to do that. (think the data in the database that will be populating the character sheet). 

Based on the following websites, create a markdown file that succinctly outlines the steps and the data we would need. Crawl through these sites and identify the different facets of the data.
